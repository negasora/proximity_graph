# Proximity Browser (v0.1)
Author: **Josh Ferrell**

_Adds a new View type of Proximity that allows interactive exploration of function call trees._

## Description:

Early testing of a proximity view for interactive exploration of function call graphs. By default it will render immediate children for the currently selected function, but double clicking any node will open/explore its children.

This is a really naive approach, but I'll improve it if there's enough interest.
